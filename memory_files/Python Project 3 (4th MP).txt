This project will familiarize you with conditional statements.

Python has 3 conditional statements:
if
elif
else

if, elif, and else are used exactly the same as Java.

One important difference is that whitespace matters. It doesn’t matter which spacing you use, but it is required (I use 3 spaces for each conditional for reference)

For example:
If there is one conditional, you would have code akin to:
if (boolean condition):
   # code here

If there are two conditionals, you would have code akin to:
if (boolean condition):
   # code here
else:
   # code here

If there are three or more conditionals, you would have code akin to:
if (boolean condition):
   # code here
elif (boolean condition):
   # code here
# more elif conditionals if necessary:
else:
   # code here

Notice how there are no opening and closing braces, and code contained within each conditional is indented.

Your project is to utilize these 3 conditionals in some way.

You should have 3 user inputs and store the variables as required. Make sure each variable entered contains a prompt to the user. Make sure one of the user inputs is a string.

You can compare strings using the == operator
For instance, if we have the code:
a = "hello"
if (a == "hello"):
   print("Hello World")
else:
   print("Hello New World")

Your code doesn’t have to produce anything useful.
