Create a folder named HTML5 (should be inside of your HTML folder on E:)

Directions:
1. Open up Notepad ++ from your USB Drive.
2. At the top, you will see a tab for Language. Go to H → HTML
3. Go to Save As… and locate the directory you created before Step 1 and type in index.

Your goal is to create a resume. It does not have to be serious. It must be school appropriate though.

You are to have the following ingredients:
1. A border around the website using CSS. (2)
2. At least 3-4 methods involving CSS. (8)
  A. One of the methods must adjust the <BODY> attributes.
  B. One of the methods must adjust the <P> attributes.
3. All tags must have closing tags. (4)
4. All opening braces ({) must have a closing brace (}) for CSS. (2)
5. The font must be changed from Times New Roman using CSS. (1)
6. There needs to be padding between the border and the text. This means that the text should not be flush against the border. (2)
7. There must be a change of background color. (1)

Note: The border, padding, background color should all be modified inside of:
BODY
{
}

Each line of CSS code should be indented and end with a semi-colon (;).

You may use the following website:

It is highly recommended that you at least glance at the CSS - Borders, CSS - Backgrounds, CSS - FONTS

Remember, all projects should begin with:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE> Title of your website here </TITLE>
…
</HEAD>
…
</HTML>

It is highly recommended to complete all of the CSS inside of <HEAD> and after <TITLE>.

All CSS code should go inside of <STYLE> and </STYLE>

Remember that each method inside of <STYLE> will overwrite the attributes of a specific tag.

For instance,
h1 
{
   color: #36CFFF; 
}

will affect the <H1> tag. Every time the <H1> tag is used in the website, the color will be cyan.

This can be done with any tag. It is highly recommended that you utilize body in this way, so everytime <BODY> is used inside of the website, the attributes inside of <STYLE> are applied.
