Java Project 22 - 3rd MP
2 points - EC

Eclipse
1. Inside of the Java folder you created, create another folder called Java22
2. Open up the Eclipse Icon on your Desktop
3. Navigate to the Java22 directory you created and select that folder
4. Click the Restore Icon on the left (it looks like a small windows button)
3. Go to File -> New -> Java Project
4. Type in the name of the project - Java22 and click Finish
5. Right click on the project on the left (in this case Java22) and go to New -> Class
7. Type in Java22 as the filename
8. Check the box for public static void main(String[] args) in the middle of the window.
9. Click Ok.
10. Press Enter before the opening brace on the first line.
11. Press Enter before the other opening brace on the 2nd or 3rd line.
12. You are ready to start your program.

Your goal is to write a method that converts a 1D array into a 2D array.

To do this, you will need a couple of things.

To get started, create a random int value from 2 to 50 inclusive. Call this variable ran. Create an int[] array with this number of elements.

Load the array with random numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.

Hint 1: Then you will need to see if there are any factors of ran. 
Hint 2: Try modifying the isPrime(n) method to return a number (int)  instead of a boolean. 
Hint 3: Once you find a factor (if there is any), you can find the other factor by dividing the random number above by this factor.

If the random number is prime, create a 2D array with singleton elements. In other words, a 2D array with 1 row.

Your method should return a 2D array and take in a 1D array as a parameter.

Create a 2D array in main that calls this method you just wrote (by assigning the array to the method call).

Then, print out both the 2D array and the 1D array and see if your program works as desired. You should use Arrays.toString(arr) to print out the 1D array and a double loop structure to print out the 2D array like a table.
