Java Project 14 - 3rd MP
2 points


Eclipse
1. Inside of the Java folder you created, create another folder called Java14
2. Open up the Eclipse Icon on your Desktop
3. Navigate to the Java14 directory you created and select that folder
4. Click the Restore Icon on the left (it looks like a small windows button)
3. Go to File -> New -> Java Project
4. Type in the name of the project - Java14 and click Finish
5. Right click on the project on the left (in this case Java14) and go to New -> Class
7. Type in Java14 as the filename
8. Check the box for public static void main(String[] args) in the middle of the window.
9. Click Ok.
10. Press Enter before the opening brace on the first line.
11. Press Enter before the other opening brace on the 2nd or 3rd line.
12. You are ready to start your program.

The purpose of this project is to discover logical operators. Remember, logical operators link Boolean expressions.

Part 1:

You will be calculating a college GPA based on the number of credits taken and the grade received.

First create a sum variable stored as a double, and initialize it to 0.0, and an int variable for total credits and initialize that to 0.

Second, prompt the user to enter a number of grades, and store this in a variable.
Create a loop that will then ask the user to enter a course with the number of credits (an int), and then the grade received.
To make it simple, use the following system:
A = 4.0
B = 3.0
C = 2.0
D = 1.0
F = 0.0
This should be stored in String variable
Have 5 if / else conditionals that will assign a double variable equal to the grade received.
For example, one of the structures will look as follows:
else if (grade.equals("B"))
   numgrade = 3.0;

Below this set of conditionals, you will need to include a line that will actually calculate the heavy part of the GPA calculation:
It should be as follows: the number of credits for the course * the grade added with the previous value of sum.

Once you are finished calculating this value, create another double value which will be the sum from above, divided by the total number of credits.
Print the GPA from above.

Here is a sample output:
Please enter the number of classes: 2
Course 1
How many credits? 4
Grade received: A
Course 2
How many credits? 3
Grade received: B
Your GPA is: 3.5714285714285716






Part 2:
Create a second project called Java14a. Create a file named Java14. Copy the contents from Part 1 into this file.

Here, you will utilize a logical operator to determine how well you did:
GPA		Phrase
3.0-4.0		Excellent Job
2.0-3.0		Nice Job
1.0-2.0		Satisfactory Job
0.0-1.0		Failing Job

To do this, you are to utilize 4 conditionals using logical operators:
|| → OR
&& → AND
! → NOT

Here are the truth tables for AND, OR, and NOT:
			AND: (&&)		OR: (||)
T	T		T			T
T	F		F			T
F	T		F			T
F	F		F			F

		NOT: (!)
T		F
F		T

Syntax will look akin to:
If x < 40 and x > 20:
if (x < 40 && x > 20)

If x < 40 or x > 80:
if (x < 40 || x > 80)

If x >= 40:
if (!(x < 40))

Here is a sample output:
Please enter the number of classes: 3
Course 1
How many credits? 2
Grade received: A
Course 2
How many credits? 3
Grade received: B
Course 3
How many credits? 4
Grade received: C
Your GPA is: 2.7777777777777777
Nice job!
