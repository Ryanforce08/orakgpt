Java Project 9 - 3rd MP
2 points

Eclipse
1. Inside of the Java folder you created, create another folder called Java9
2. Open up the Eclipse Icon on your Desktop
3. Navigate to the Java9 directory you created and select that folder
4. Click the Restore Icon on the left (it looks like a small windows button)
3. Go to File -> New -> Java Project
4. Type in the name of the project - Java9 and click Finish
5. Right click on the project on the left (in this case Java9) and go to New -> Class
7. Type in Java9 as the filename
8. Check the box for public static void main(String[] args) in the middle of the window.
9. Click Ok.
10. Press Enter before the opening brace on the first line.
11. Press Enter before the other opening brace on the 2nd or 3rd line.
12. You are ready to start your program.

The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with various loops.

You’ve already learned the syntax for a while loop:
while (boolean expression)
{
   Code here;
}

Remember that the while loop executes as long as the boolean condition is true.

Part 1:
Your goal is to display the numbers 1 through 100 on the screen utilizing a while loop
To do this, you should create a variable that is initialized to 1
Then you will need to increment the variable each time until it reaches 100.
There are two ways to do this, both of which you need to know:
If the variable is called x, then the following 3 statements are equivalent:
x++;		x = x + 1;		x += 1;
Here, 1 is added to x and then assigns it back into x


Part 2:
Create a new Java Project. Call this project Java9a
Create a new class file called Java9a

The goal of this project is to utilize a for loop.

A for loop has the following syntax:
for (initialization; boolean condition; modification)
{
   Code here;
}

For example, try the following:
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
{
   System.out.println("Hello World!");
}

Notice how “Hello World!” is printed to the screen 4 times.
The variable i functions as a counter variable. The incrementing is performed in the modification portion of a for loop
The boolean condition here is i < 4
Counter starts out at 0 and since 0 < 4, loop executes
Once body of loop is complete, counter is incremented by 1
Counter is now 1 and since 1 < 4, loop executes
…
Counter is now 4 and since 4 is not less than 4, loop no longer executes

Your goal of this project is to print out all the numbers of 1 to 100 in reverse order.
You will need to decrement rather than increment in this case
You may either use:
x--; 		x = x - 1;		x -= 1;
All statements are identically the same
