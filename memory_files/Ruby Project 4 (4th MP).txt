This project will familiarize you with loop structures.

Ruby has a variety of loop structures. There are 5 of them, but this project will focus on 4 of them.
Here are the following loop structures:
1. while loop
2. for loop
3. until loop
4. times loop
5. each loop

while loop:
This functions analogously to Java - meaning, it functions exactly the same. The syntax is also the same.
For example, to print out your name 4 times to the screen:
i = 0
while (i < 4)
   puts “Brian Orak”
   i = i + 1 # you could also use i += 1, but i++ is not valid syntax
end


for loop:
This functions analogously to Java, but the loop can only count by 1.
For example, to print out your name 4 times to the screen:
for i in 0..3
   puts “Brian Orak”
end

Note that .. will designate inclusion of both numbers. If the first line of the loop was:
for i in 0...3 
3 will not be included. It will cycle through 0, 1, and 2.






until loop:
This is a new kind of loop, and will execute until a certain condition is met.
For example, to print your name to the screen 4 times:
i = 0
until (i == 4)
   puts “Brian Orak”
   i += 1
end


times loop:
This is also a new kind of loop, and will execute a specific number of times. It can be done two different ways.
To print your name to the screen 4 times, the following syntax will work:
# Method 1
4.times { puts “Brian Orak” }

# Method 2
4.times do
   puts “Brian Orak”
end

Both do the exact same thing. Make sure you are familiar with both styles.


Your goal is to create a program that utilizes each of these loops. Your program doesn’t have to do anything useful. But you should familiarize yourself with these structures.
