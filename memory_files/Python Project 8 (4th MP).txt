Create a Folder inside of Python called Python8

Create a file called python8.py

This project will have you play a guessing game with the computer.

This project is similar to Python7. However, you are coming up with the random number (between 1-100 inclusive), and the computer will guess the number.

You have to specify whether the number is higher or lower.

Using the example from yesterday,
1. If your number is 42, the computer will guess 50 first. You say “lower”.
2. 50 would then be the max, so the computer will guess 25. You say “higher”.
3. 25 would now be the min, so the computer will guess 37. You say “higher”.
4. 37 would now be the min, so the computer will guess 43. You say “lower”.
5. 43 would now be the max, so the computer will guess 40. You say “higher”.
6. 40 would now be the min, so the computer will guess 41. You say “higher”.
7. 41 would now be the min, so the computer will guess 42. 42 is correct.
The maximum number of tries will always be 7.

Hint: specify a range from 1-100 (100 being max and 1 being min).
Alter the max and min as needed. Remember the computer will always guess the middle number (min + max) / 2. Since Python converts all numbers to decimals, be sure to type cast this number back as an integer.
