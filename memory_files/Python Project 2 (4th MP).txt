Python Project 2
1 point

Create a Folder inside of Python called Python2
Create a file called python2.py

This project will focus on user input.

All user input will require a prompt in Python, and it should be stored in as a variable.

An example would be as follows:
s = input("Please enter your name: ")
s is now stored as a string

It could also be used as an integer:
n = input("Please enter a number: ")
n = int(n)

Here, int(n) will convert n to an integer.

If you recall from Python1, you can convert an object to a string by using str(s)

Your goal is the following
You are to ask the user for a name and 2 numbers
You are to perform 6 mathematical operations on the number you enter, and display them in a string to the screen
Print out the results using the value you received from each of the operations and the variables as well. Make the output look presentable.
Here are the six mathematical operations:
+, -, /, *, %, **
