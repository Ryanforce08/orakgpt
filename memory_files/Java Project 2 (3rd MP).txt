The point of this project is to familiarize yourself with how a String will be displayed.

There are a number of escape sequences in Java that can be used inside Strings.
Here are a few with their meanings:
\r → carriage return, return to beginning of line
\n → return a line
\t → creates a tab
\’ → displays a ‘
\\ → displays a \
\” → displays a “

Remember, all code that you want printed to the screen should be contained in either of the two following statements:
System.out.print();
System.out.println();

Discover the difference between these two statements.

Code that is inside a string should always be contained in quotes, and should be placed inside of the () from above.

Your goal is to print the following message to the screen (include the quotes and slashes):
"Hello, my name	is "Brian Orak". '\"

Use one print statement for this code. There is a tab between name and is.
