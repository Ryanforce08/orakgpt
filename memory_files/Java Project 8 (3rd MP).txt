Java Project 8 - 3rd MP
1 point

Eclipse
1. Inside of the Java folder you created, create another folder called Java8
2. Open up the Eclipse Icon on your Desktop
3. Navigate to the Java8 directory you created and select that folder
4. Click the Restore Icon on the left (it looks like a small windows button)
3. Go to File -> New -> Java Project
4. Type in the name of the project - Java8 and click Finish
5. Right click on the project on the left (in this case Java8) and go to New -> Class
7. Type in Java8 as the filename
8. Check the box for public static void main(String[] args) in the middle of the window.
9. Click Ok.
10. Press Enter before the opening brace on the first line.
11. Press Enter before the other opening brace on the 2nd or 3rd line.
12. You are ready to start your program.

The goal of this project is to learn about loops and dealing with input switching from integers to Strings.

Declare a Scanner variable:
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

Try the following code:
int x;
String y;
System.out.print("Please enter a number: ");
x = s.nextInt();
System.out.print("Please enter a String: ");
y = s.nextLine();
System.out.println(x + y);

What happens?

To stop this from happening, you need to include a dummy input between inputting an integer and a String.

Try the following:
int x;
String y;
String dummy;
System.out.print("Please enter a number: ");
x = s.nextInt();
System.out.print("Please enter a String: ");
dummy = s.nextLine();
y = s.nextLine();
System.out.println(x + y);

The code should work as intended now.

From Code.org and Alice, you learned that a while loop is a type of loop.

To get started today, we will utilize an infinite while loop.

The syntax is as follows for a while loop:
while (Boolean condition)
{
   Code here;
}

To make an infinite while loop, use the keyword true in place of the Boolean condition.

You can also make a while loop count a specific number of times.

For example,
int i = 1;
while (i <= 20)
{
   System.out.println("Honors Programming" + i);
   i += 1;
}

This will print out “Honors Programming” 20 times. This is called a definite loop.

You can also use a while loop for an indefinite number of times.
For example:

int i = 1;
while (i != 20)
{
   System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
   i = s.nextInt();
}

Here, the loop will repeat until the user enters 20. This is called an indefinite loop.

Your goal is to practice using loops and dealing with a dummy variable.
