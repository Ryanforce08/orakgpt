Python Project 11
2 points

Create a Folder inside of Python called Python11

Create a file called python11.py

This project will focus on recursion.

Recursion is utilized the same way as Ruby and Java - a method (or function) is called within itself.

Your goal is to return True if an element is located inside an array, and False otherwise.

For example:
If the array had [2, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3] and you were looking for a key of 8, you would get False back. If you were looking for a key of 7, you would get True back.

You must utilize recursion in this project.

Your function should either take 2 or 3 parameters:
If 2 parameters - the array itself and the key
If 3 parameters - the array itself, the key, and the size (count down) or 0 (count up)

You can complete this how you wish, but you must utilize a recursive function.
