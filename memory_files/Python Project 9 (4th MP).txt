Python Project 9
1 point

Create a Folder inside of Python called Python9

Create a file called python9.py

This project will familiarize yourself with random numbers.

To create a random number, we first need to import the random library:
import random

To actually create a random integer, you will need the following syntax:
random.randint(x, y)
where x is the minimum value for your range, and y is the maximum value. The random number will be inclusive of these two numbers.

Your goal is to create 10000 random numbers from 1-10000 inclusive without the use of an array.
You are to find the mean, range, minimum, and maximum.

For reference, if you want a random decimal between 0 and 1, use the following syntax:
random.random()

Of course this can be extended to a range of numbers simply by multiplying that by a certain integer.
