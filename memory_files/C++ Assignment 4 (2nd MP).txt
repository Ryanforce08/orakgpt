1. Write the output of the following segment of code: (13)
    string s1 = "abcdedcbabcdedcbabcde";
    string s2 = "b";
    int num1 = 3;
    int num2 = 4;
    cout << s1.length() << endl;
    cout << s1.at(num1) << endl;
    cout << s1.find(s2) << endl;
    cout << s1.find(s2, num1) << endl;
    cout << s1.compare(s2) << endl;
    cout << s2.compare(s1) << endl;
    cout << s1.empty() << endl;
    cout << s1.substr(num1, num2) << endl;
    cout << s1.erase(num1, num2) << endl;
    s1.swap(s2);
    cout << s1 << endl;
    s1.swap(s2);
    cout << s1.front() << endl;
    cout << s1.back() << endl;
    s1.replace(num1, num2, s2);
    cout << s1 << endl;

2. Define and list the return types for the following functions: (14)
a. find(s2)


b. find(s2, num1)


c. compare(s2)


d. substr(num1, num2)


e. erase(num1, num2)


f. swap(s2)


g. replace(num1, num2, s2)



3. What is an array? (1)



4. What must be true about every element of a single array? (1)



5. What two things must be known before declaring / initializing an array? (2)



6. Declare an array of 100 int types. (1)



7. Declare an array of 100 string types. (1)



8. Declare and initialize on one line an array of int types with the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive. (2)



9. Declare an array of 10 int types on one line, then load the array with the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive using a loop. (3)



10. What is an index in an array? (1)



11. What is the range of the indices of an array with 100 elements? (1)



12. What is the range of the indices of an array with n elements? (1)


13. Write a segment of code to determine the length of an array (the number of elements). Assume the type of the array is a string. (1)



14. What does sizeof(arr) find? (1)



15. What does sizeof(type) find? (1)



16. Print out the contents of an array, named arr (of type bool) to the screen in a nice / neat format. (3)



17. Print out the contents of an array, named arr2 (of type string) using my function in Prog 14. (3)



18. What header file do you need to include to do this? (1)



19. What does to_string(el) do? (1)



20. Why do you need to remove the to_string(el) in my algorithm for printing a string array? (1)



21. What is a two-dimensional array? (1)



22. Declare a two-dimensional string array with 3 columns and 2 rows. (1)



23. Declare and initialize on one line a two-dimensional array as follows: (2)
[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11]]



24. Use a double loop to declare and initialize the above two-dimensional array. In other words, declare the array on one line, then load the array using a loop. (4)




25. Print the contents of the two-dimensional array to the screen. (4)
