There are two options for starting HTML:

Option 1 - USB Drive
1. Create a Folder on your P:\ (possibly in an HTML Folder) and call it HTML1.
2. Open up Notepad ++ from your USB Drive.
3. At the top, you will see a tab for Language. Go to H → HTML
4. Go to Save As… and locate the directory you created in Step 1 and type in first.

Once everything is set up, you’re free to experiment with this project.

Check the other document for a basic idea on how HTML works.

If you are in Notepad++, be sure to go to File → Save to save your work.

Once your project is saved, open up the .html file in the proper directory to view your website.
