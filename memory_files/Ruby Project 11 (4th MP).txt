Create a Folder inside of Ruby called Ruby11

This project focuses on recursion.

Part 1:
Create a file inside of Ruby11 called ruby11a.rb
You are to create a recursive method for the Fibonacci numbers and the factorial function.


Part 2:
Create a file inside of Ruby11 called ruby11b.rb

You are to write a recursive method in Ruby to find exponents.

There should be two parameters that come into the method: the base and the power
Therefore, your method header should look like:

def power(a, b)
   # code here
end
