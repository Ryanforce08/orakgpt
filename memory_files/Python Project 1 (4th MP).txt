Python Project 1
1 point

Create a Folder inside of Python called Python1
Create a file called python1.py

In a Python project, you do not need to start your file with public class Python1.
You also do not need public static void main (String[] args) for your main method.
You also do not need opening and closing braces.

To display simple text to the screen, use print()
The method print() works very similar to System.out.println() from Java or puts in Ruby

The syntax is somewhat similar to Ruby.

The goal of this project is to display "Hello World" to the screen.

Below "Hello World", you are to create a variable and store your age in it. Do not use semicolons.

You are then going to print the following line three different ways, all of which you are responsible for:
I am __ years old
where __ refers to the age you stored in a variable.

To do this, utilize the following syntax:
1. "I","am",__,"years","old"
2. "I am " + str(__) + " years old"
3. "I am %s years old" %(__)
