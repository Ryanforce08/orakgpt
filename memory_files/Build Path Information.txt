In order to make the red X marks go away (and actually be able to debug your code), you must do the following:

1. In Eclipse, on the left, you should see the names of your projects. Right click and go to Build Path and then to Configure Build Path...

2. At the top, in the middle, select the Libraries Tab.

3. Click on the library that is there and go to Remove.

4. Click Add Library...

5. Select JRE System Library and select Next.

6. Click Finish at the bottom.

7. Press OK at the bottom of the window.

This should resolve your issues.
