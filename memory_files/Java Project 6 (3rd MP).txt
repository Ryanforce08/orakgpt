Java Project 6 - 3rd MP
2 points

Eclipse
1. Inside of the Java folder you created, create another folder called Java6
2. Open up the Eclipse Icon on your Desktop
3. Navigate to the Java6 directory you created and select that folder
4. Click the Restore Icon on the left (it looks like a small windows button)
3. Go to File -> New -> Java Project
4. Type in the name of the project - Java6 and click Finish
5. Right click on the project on the left (in this case Java6) and go to New -> Class
7. Type in Java6 as the filename
8. Check the box for public static void main(String[] args) in the middle of the window.
9. Click Ok.
10. Press Enter before the opening brace on the first line.
11. Press Enter before the other opening brace on the 2nd or 3rd line.
12. You are ready to start your program.

The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with various String methods.

We will cover 12 of them in this class.

To get started, declare some ints and Strings as follows:
String s1 = " hello world ";
String s2 = "l";
String s3 = "W";
int i1 = 4;
int i2 = 7;

You are to find the following:
The definition and return types of the following methods.
1. .trim()
2. .toUpperCase()
3. .toLowerCase()
4. .charAt((integer))
5. .indexOf((string))
6. .indexOf((string), (integer))
7. .replace((string), (string))
8. .length()
9. .equals((string))
10. .substring((integer))
11. .substring((integer), (integer))
12. .compareTo((string))

There are 10 different methods. You will be required to know both variations of .substring() and .indexOf()

To test what these methods do, put them inside of print statements as follows:

System.out.println(s1.trim());
System.out.println(s1.toUpperCase());
System.out.println(s1.toLowerCase());
System.out.println(s1.charAt(i1));
System.out.println(s1.indexOf(s2));
System.out.println(s1.indexOf(s2, i1));
System.out.println(s1.replace(s2, s3));
System.out.println(s1.length());
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
System.out.println(s1.substring(i1));
System.out.println(s1.substring(i1, i2));
System.out.println(s2.compareTo(s3));

The method .compareTo() will probably be the hardest to figure out what it does.
Notice how the parameters correspond from 1-12 inside of these print statements.

Also note that using these methods WILL NOT alter the contents of the string, it will simply display the result of performing an operation.

If you want to modify a string by these, you will have to set the original string equal to it.
For example: 
String s4 = "Brian";
String s5 = "r";
String s6 = "R";
s4.replace(s5, s6);
System.out.println(s4);
s4 = s4.replace(s5, s6);
System.out.println(s4);

Create a list of comments - 1 - 12. Each number will correspond to the methods listed above. You are to find the return type and definition for all 12.
