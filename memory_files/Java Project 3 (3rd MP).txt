Java Project 3 - 3rd MP
1 point

Eclipse
1. Inside of the Java folder you created, create another folder called Java3
2. Open up the Eclipse Icon on your Desktop
3. Navigate to the Java3 directory you created and select that folder
4. Click the Restore Icon on the left (it looks like a small windows button)
3. Go to File -> New -> Java Project
4. Type in the name of the project - Java3 and click Finish
5. Right click on the project on the left (in this case Java3) and go to New -> Class
7. Type in Java3 as the filename
8. Check the box for public static void main(String[] args) in the middle of the window.
9. Click Ok.
10. Press Enter before the opening brace on the first line.
11. Press Enter before the other opening brace on the 2nd or 3rd line.
12. You are ready to start your program.

The goal of this project is to learn about variables.

In order for you to utilize a variable, you have to declare it and know its type.

There are 9 variable types you can declare without importing a class.
Technically, there are 17, but 8 of these you will not learn until AP Computer Science A.

Here are the 9 types you can use:
* 1. String → A String inside of quotes

* 2. int → An integer from -231 to 231 - 1
* 3. double → A decimal value either positive or negative from 4.9E-324 to 1.7976931348623157E308
* 4. boolean → A value of either true or false
* 5. char → A character ranging from the ASCII value of 0 to 255, or a character between single quotes
6. float → A decimal value either positive or negative from 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E38. Must have the letter F or f at the end of the line.
* 7. long → An integer from -263 to 263 - 1
8. short → An integer from -215 to 215 - 1
9. byte → An integer from -27 to 27 - 1

The types with a * are ones that are most common and ones we will use throughout the year.
In #3 and #6, the letter E represents “times 10 to the power of”
For example, the number 3.774E5 would be 377400.

The type String is an object and the other 8 types are primitive types.
This simply means there is no class associated with the primitive type.

Declaring a variable would be utilizing the following syntax:
type var = value;

Your goal is to declare 9 of these variables (1 of each type), and then display them to the screen in 9 println() statements.
You can put the variable in the println() statements directly, and should not contain quotes.
