Java Project 1 - 3rd MP
1 point

Create a folder on your flash drive inside of Honors Programming for Java.

Follow the steps below exactly. All projects during this marking period will utilize this setup. Pay very close attention to capitalization and spacing (especially if there is none).

Eclipse
1. Inside of the Java folder you created, create another folder called Java1
2. Open up the Eclipse Icon on your Desktop
3. Navigate to the Java1 directory you created and select that folder
4. Click the Restore Icon on the left (it looks like a small windows button)
3. Go to File -> New -> Java Project
4. Type in the name of the project - Java1 and click Finish
5. Right click on the project on the left (in this case Java1) and go to New -> Class
7. Type in Java1 as the filename
8. Check the box for public static void main(String[] args) in the middle of the window
9. Click Ok.
10. Press Enter before the opening brace on the first line.
11. Press Enter before the other opening brace on the 2nd or 3rd line.
12. You are ready to start your program.

All basic Java programs should start out with the following line:
public class _______ 

You should put your program name in the underlined portion (in this case Java1)

Under that and on a separate line, you should have an opening brace: {

All code inside of {} should be indented. 
For each level of {}, we use another level of indentation

Below the {, we should include the line:
public static void main (String[] args)

Below that, we include another opening brace on a separate line: {
Below the line with {, include on a separate line: 
System.out.println("Hello World");

There should be 2 sets of closing braces (}) on separate lines below. If not, include them.

At the top, press the green Play button to compile and run your program.
"Hello World" should be displayed.
