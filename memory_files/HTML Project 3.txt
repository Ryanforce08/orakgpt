HTML Project 3

2 points

Create a folder named HTML3 (should be inside of your HTML folder on P:)

Directions:
1. Open up Notepad ++ from your USB Drive.
2. At the top, you will see a tab for Language. Go to H → HTML
3. Go to Save As… and locate the directory you created before Step 1 and type in index.

Add to your HTML file a table of your classes with their schedule.

To do this, we have the following table markup tags:

<TABLE>		Defines a table
<CAPTION>		Defines the title of the table (The default position of the
			table is at the top of the table but ALIGN=BOTTOM can also
			be used.)
<TR>			Defines a row within a table.
<TH>			Defines a table header cell.
<TD>			Defines a table data cell.

We also have the following attribute tags:
BORDER		Used with <TABLE>			Displays a border
ALIGN			Used with all tags		Horizontal alignment of
								elements in cells
VALIGN		All tags except CAPTION		Vertical alignment of cells
ROWSPAN=n		Used with <TD>			The number of rows that a cell
								spans
COLSPAN=n		Used with <TD>			The number of columns that a
								cell spans
NOWRAP		All tags except CAPTION		Turn off word wrap within a
								cell

The format of a table should look as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION> Title of the table </CAPTION>

<TR>
<TH> Header of the first column </TH>
…
<TH> Header of the last column </TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD> Contents of the first data cell in first row </TD>
…
<TD> Contents of the last data cell in first row </TD>
</TR>
…
<TR>
<TD> Contents of the first data cell in last row </TD>
…
<TD> Contents of the last data cell in the last row </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


Here is an example of a table:
<TABLE BORDER>

<CAPTION ALIGN=CENTER>
Computer Science 111 - Fundamentals of Data Structures
