Python Project 7
1 point

Create a Folder inside of Python called Python7

Create a file called python7.py

This project will have you play a guessing game with the computer.

Have the computer guess a random number from 1-100 inclusive.

To create a random number, we first need to import the random library:
import random

To actually create a random integer, you will need the following syntax:
random.randint(x, y)
where x is the minimum value for your range, and y is the maximum value. The random number will be inclusive of these two numbers.

Display a count for how many times it takes the user to guess the correct number. It should always be 7 or less.

If the user guesses wrong, display to the screen if the number is higher or lower than the guessed number. 

When the count reaches 7, stop the user from guessing. If the user fails, display “Failed”. If the user succeeds, display “Won in __  tries” where __ refers to the count from above.

The reason the count should always be 7 or less is because guessing in the middle of the range will perform an optimal solution.

For example,
1. If the computer has the number at 42, you should guess 50 first.
2. 50 would then be the max, so you would guess 25.
3. 25 would now be the min, so you would guess 37
4. 37 would now be the min, so you would guess 43
5. 43 would now be the max, so you would guess 40
6. 40 would now be the min, so you would guess 41
7. 41 would now be the min, so you would guess 42
42 is correct.

This strategy is important for Python 9 where you will be choosing a random number, and the computer will be guessing. You would say higher or lower and the computer will fix the range and always guess in the middle.
