Python instructions:

Open up IDLE - Type IDLE into start menu or locate it on the Desktop

Go to File - New 
Before running, save it to your proper directory (E:\Python\Python__)

To run your project, go to Run - Run Module.


Below: Not normally used.

Open up IDLE - Type IDLE into start menu

1. Type: 
import os

2. To see what the current directory is, type:
os.getcwd()

3. To change your directory, type:
os.chdir(‘P:\\Python’) 
You can use whatever directory you want. This was convenient for me. Your projects will be stored in sub folders. Separate them by \\ for each directory

4. There are two ways to ‘run’ a program:
a. Type the following commands in order:
py = open(‘./filename.py’).read()
co = compile(py, ‘<string>’, ‘exec’)
exec(co)

b. File → Open
Find your filename.py and click Open
A new window should open. Click on Run, and go to Run Module
