Ruby Project 5
1 point

Create a Folder inside of Ruby called Ruby5
Create a file called ruby5.rb

This project will familiarize yourself with:
1. Random numbers
2. Writing methods


Random numbers:
To create a random integer between 0 and n - 1, use the following syntax:
rand(n)

This can also be added to numerical expressions as well. For example, if you wanted to create a random number between 104 and 130 (both inclusive) and store it in a variable named x, use the following statement:
x = 104 + rand(27)


Writing methods:
Methods should be written at the beginning of your program. They will have the following syntax:

For 0 parameters:
def methodname()
   # code here
end

For 1 parameter:
def methodname(a)
   # code here
end

For 2 parameters:
def methodname(a, b)
   # code here
end

A return type is not to be specified. You can return values similar to Java if desired.
Code inside a method should be indented 2-4 spaces or tabbed.
Methods begin with the keyword def and end with the keyword end.

The parameters a, b, â€¦ should not be the same name as a variable inside of your actual program. These values are simply passed in and can be used in the method only.

The goal of this project is to create 2 methods:
1. Create a method with no parameters that displays a 3 line message to the screen and does not return any number.
2. Inside of your program, prompt the user to specify a range of values for random numbers (both beginning and end, inclusive). Pass both of these variables into a method and create 100 random numbers between these two ranges. Find the average of these random numbers and return it back to your program. Call your method in a print / puts statement stating that it is the average.
