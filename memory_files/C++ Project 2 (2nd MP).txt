C++ Project 2
1 point

Goals:
1. Learn String concatenation
2. Learn Escape sequences

To get started:
To create a new project, click Create a new project. Then click Empty Project. Click Next

For the Project name, type Prog2. Click the 3 dots (...) for the location. Select the Prog2 folder you created above. No other options need to be changed for now. Click Create.

If an advertising window appears, click the little X at the top left.

To add a file (a class), right click on Source files. Go to Add → New Item…
Type Prog2 for the file name. NO SPACES. Click Add.

String concatenation is the combining of a string and another string and creating a larger string. For example, "Hello" + string("World") would create the larger string "HelloWorld".

Escape sequences are a sequence of characters inside a string that allow for various special characters to be returned. Escape sequences always start with a \.
Here are some escape sequences:
"\n" → returns a line
"\t" → returns a tab
"\\" → returns a \
"\'" → returns a ‘
"\"" → returns a “
"\r" → carriage return (go to beginning of the line)

Note a carriage return will overwrite text if printing to the screen

You can use string concatenation to combine numbers and strings to outputs. Items can be separated using the << operator.









Directions: You are to display the following to the screen all of the following exercises, each with a single line of code:

A. A forward slash looks like / and a backslash looks like \
B. 2000 is the first year of the century (do not use numbers inside of quotes)
C. She said, "I'm tired of this."
D.       x	y
     1	2
E. The character 'A' has an ASCII value of 65
F. Hi. My name is Brian (use each word in quotes by itself using << operator)
