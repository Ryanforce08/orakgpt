Ruby Project 8
1 point

Create a Folder inside of Ruby called Ruby8

This project will familiarize yourself with:
1. Sorting arrays
2. Importing a file

Choose a sorting algorithm from Sorting2 in Java. Create a Ruby file with the name of that corresponding Java file.

Convert the algorithm from Java to Ruby. The only line of code you will need to add is:
return a
This is added at the very bottom of the method before end

Create a file named ruby8.rb

At the top of the program, use the code:
load ‘__________.rb’
Where __________ is the name of the file you created above.
Be sure to change the ‘ and ’ from Google Drive to standard apostrophes.

Create a blank array, then fill it with random integers from 0-1000.

Call the sorting method with the array as the parameter.

Finally, print the sorted array to the screen.
