This project will familiarize you with loop structures.

Ruby has a variety of loop structures. There are 3 of them, but this project will focus on 2 of them.
Here are the following loop structures:
1. while loop
2. for loop
3. for loop using each structure

while loop:
This functions analogously to Java - meaning, it functions exactly the same. The syntax is also the same.
For example, to print out your name 4 times to the screen:
i = 0
while (i < 4):
   print("Brian Orak")
   i = i + 1 # you could also use i += 1, but i++ is not valid syntax


for loop:
This functions analogously to Java, but the loop can only count by 1.
For example, to print out your name 4 times to the screen:
for i in range(4):
   print("Brian Orak")

Here, i will be in the range 0, 1, 2, 3. Note that 4 is not included.

A for loop can also start at a specific location (other than 0)
For example
for i in range(5, 9):
   print("Brian Orak %s" %(i))

Here, i will be in the range 5, 6, 7, 8. Note that 9 is not included




break keyword: The syntax is identical to Java or Ruby.
This is used to break out of the innermost loop.

For reference, if a boolean variable is desired, the possibilities are True or False. Note that these choices are capitalized.

Your goal is to use two examples of a while loop and two examples of a for loop (using the range feature). You are to utilize the break keyword in some aspect: Use it with an infinite while loop.
