Your goal is to find the mode of a data set.

The data set you will be using is:
1. Create an array (or ArrayList) of 15 int (or Integer) elements
2. Load the array with a random number from 0 to 10 (both inclusive).

Then you must find the mode. Remember the mode is the most frequent element in the data set. You can use any previous project from Java / C++ for reference. You may use any syntax that we have covered before in this course.

The mode must be in an array.

Note - there may be 1 mode or multiple modes.

Print out the original array and the mode array. Instead of using a loop to do this, use an alternative way to print out an array:
First, import the Arrays class: 
import java.util.Arrays;
Second, you can simply print out an array directly using the following syntax:
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
