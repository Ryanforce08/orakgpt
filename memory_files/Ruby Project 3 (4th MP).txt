Ruby Project 3

Create a Folder inside of Ruby called Ruby3
Create a file called ruby3.rb

This project will familiarize you with conditional statements.

Ruby has 4 conditional statements:
if
elsif
else
unless

if, elsif, and else are used exactly the same as Java.

For example:
If there is one conditional, you would have code akin to:
if (boolean condition)
   # code here
end

If there are two conditionals, you would have code akin to:
if (boolean condition)
   # code here
else
   # code here
end

If there are three or more conditionals, you would have code akin to:
if (boolean condition)
   # code here
elsif (boolean condition)
   # code here
# more elsif conditionals if necessary
else
   # code here
end

Notice how there are no opening and closing braces, and code contained within each conditional is indented. You will be required to use anywhere from 2-4 spaces or a tab. The keyword end designates the end of a conditional.

The unless conditional is useful if only one case is being satisfied (mainly used for a loop, which you will learn later.)
It is used with code akin to:
unless (boolean condition)
   # code here
end

Your project is to utilize these 4 conditionals in some way.

You must use two instances of numbers and two instances of strings. You must also use the .eql? method below for strings once.

A useful method in Ruby is the .eql? method
For instance, if we have the code:
a = "hello"
if (a.eql? "hello")
   print "Hello World"
else
   print "Goodbye World"
end

Your code doesnâ€™t have to produce anything useful.
