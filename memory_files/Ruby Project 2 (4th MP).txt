Variables can be utilized similar to Java, but they do not need to be declared to use them.

To receive user input, we use the keyword gets.

There are a few quirks to gets:
1. The value stored is an object (meaning you can store a String, byte, integer, floating point, etc.)
2a. After pressing Enter, there will be a trailing \n for where you pressed Enter
2b. To remove the \n at the end, utilize the method .chomp
3. It is advised to store your input into a variable.

The following methods convert the object to a desired format:
1. Object to integer → .to_i
2. Object to String → .to_s
3. Object to float → .to_f
4. Object to array → .to_a
5. Object to hash → .to_h
We mainly only have to worry about integers, strings, and floats for now.

Assume we have the code:
print "Please enter an integer: "
input = gets.chomp.to_i

If you want to print your integer to the screen along with a string, you have to convert the variable to a string as well:
puts "The value you entered is: " + input.to_s

We can also use these methods in conjunction with one another. For example:
print "Please enter an integer: "
input = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "5 times the number you entered is: " + (5 * input).to_s
Notice how input is converted to an integer and being multiplied by 5
Then we take that number and convert it to a String.

You are only allowed to print one type of output per print / puts statement. In other words, if there are strings and integers, you must convert them all to strings or all to integers.



There are 6 mathematical operators in Ruby: 
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Integer / floating point division
%	Modulus
**	Exponentiation

Your goal is to write a program that will ask the user for input, then perform a mathematical calculation with that input variable, and display it to the screen in a print statement.
