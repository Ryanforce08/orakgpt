Python Project 6
1 point

Create a Folder inside of Python called Python6

Part 1:

Create a file called python6.py

This project will familiarize yourself with functions. In Ruby and Java, they are called methods. A method has a separate definition that is beyond our scope.

To create a function with no parameters, use the following syntax:
def func:
   # code here

To call the method, simply type func()

To create a function with parameters, pass them in just like you would in Ruby or Java:

def func(a, b):
   # code here

To call the method, simply type func(x, y)

For your project, you will ask the user for a number

You will write 3 functions:

Function 1:
Return the sum of all numbers from 1 to the number entered

Function 2:
Return the sum of all the squares of numbers from 1 to the number entered

Function 3:
Return the sum of all the cubes of the numbers from 1 to the number entered

Each of these functions should return a value. You should have a print statement for each of the method calls, where it displays that number to the screen.
